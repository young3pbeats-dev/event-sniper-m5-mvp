# EVENT DEFINITION

This document defines what an "EVENT" is for the event-sniper-m5-mvp system.

An EVENT is **not** a keyword, a token, or a social post.

An EVENT is a **measurable anomaly of attention** that may generate a new crypto narrative.

---

## 1. What an EVENT is

An EVENT is detected when **one or more signals spike abnormally** within a short time window.

Examples of signals:
- Sudden increase in newly created DEX pairs
- Sudden increase in volume across unrelated pairs
- Emergence of new repeated terms in token names/symbols
- Correlated activity across multiple sources (DEX + news)

The system does not try to "understand the news".
It detects **attention shifts**.

---

## 2. What an EVENT is NOT

- NOT a static keyword (e.g. "venezuela", "trump")
- NOT a single tweet or post
- NOT a prediction
- NOT a guarantee of profitability

---

## 3. EVENT Confidence Levels

Each EVENT is classified with a confidence level:

- LOW: weak or isolated signal
- MEDIUM: multiple correlated signals
- HIGH: strong multi-source anomaly

Only MEDIUM and HIGH events are eligible for trading signals.

## 4. EVENT Lifecycle

1. Detection
2. Validation
3. Signal generation
4. Expiration

An EVENT expires automatically after a fixed time window.
Expired events are never reused.

---

## 5. Human-in-the-loop Principle

No EVENT can trigger real execution without:
- explicit AUTO mode
- or physical confirmation via M5 device

This system prioritizes discipline over speed.
